Welcome to BioModME's documentation!
------------------------------------
BioModME is an application that is meant to streamline building biological 
computational models. It is an all-in-one tool that allows the user to build 
a model, solve for its mathematical equations, and plot all relevant features.

First Steps
-----------------------------------
Are you new to BioModME or computational modeling? This is the place to start!

* **Access:** 
  :doc:`Online Application <pages/gettingStarted/useonline>` |
  :doc:`Download <pages/gettingStarted/downloadtoR>`

* **Tutorials:** 
  :doc:`Basic Model <pages/tutorial_sc_index>` |
  :doc:`MultiCompartment Model <pages/tutorial_mc_index>`

How the documentation is organized
------------------------------------
The documentation is split into the following sections:

**Getting Started**
   Contains all the information on accessing/downloading the application for 
   use.

**API**
   Explains the specifics of tabs and pages of the application. If you are 
   wondering what a specific option or button does, this is the place to check!

**Mathematical Information**
   This section contains all the mathematical explainations that goes into 
   solving the mathematical differential equations. See how the equations are
   derived or what a specific equation building option results in.

**Tutorials**
   Great place to start to learn the ins and outs of how to use BioModME. We 
   provide tutorials for multiple model types and tutorials on how to use some
   of the more tricky features of the application.
