Define Variables
==============================

There are two variables (**A** & **B**) to add to all four compartments. 
We will make use of the "Add To All Compartments" option to quickly add the 
same species to all compartments. 

Steps: 

#. Select the "Add To All Compartments" checkbox.

#. Press the "**+**" button to generate a popup.
#. In Popup type "A B" separated by a space. Check "Numerical" instead of 
   "Compartment Name" and press the add button. This will add the variables
   **A_1**, **A_2**, **A_3**, **A_4**, **B_1**, **B_2**, **B_3**, and **B_4**
   to the model.
