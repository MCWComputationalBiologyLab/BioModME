Accessing BioModME
============================

BioModME was built using the R programming language and shiny framework.  
Specific elements of the application have been modified with the use of 
customized HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As such, the application is provided 
through a variety of methods for the userâ€™s convenience including online 
deployed versions, source code to be locally used, and as a docker image
for local use avoiding dependencies. 

.. note::
    Online Server is a good option that requires no download of application or 
    knowledge of running R. 

    We intend to package the application with Electron to have a fully 
    deployable version.
